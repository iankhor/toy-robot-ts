## Notes

1. Chosen to use a create-react-app, [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), to provide an interface for user input
2. There is a button to prefill an example command sequence (to simulate test data to exercise the application)
3. Simple input validation was implemented to cater for most cases of errorneous user input
